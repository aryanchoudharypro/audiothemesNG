</ul>
<h3>Creating and editing audio themes</h3>
<p>The interface for creating and editing audio themes is pretty intuitive and self-explanatory, it is the same whether you are creating a new audio theme or editing an existing one. The only difference is that pressing the save button when creating an audio theme will package and save the new theme to a file, and pressing the save button when editing an audio theme will save your changes to the existing audio theme.</p>
<h4>Creating a new audio theme</h4>
<p>To create an audio theme follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>From NVDA's menu, activate the "Audio Themes Studio" menu item</li>
<li>From the Audio Themes Studio, activate the "Create new audio theme" button</li>
<li>In the "Enter theme information" dialog, type in the theme name, author, and description</li>
<li>The first thing that faces you in the next dialog is a list of the currently added sounds. When creating a new audio theme, this list will be initially empty.</li>
<li>To add a new sound, activate the "Add..." button, a dialog containing a list of object's roles would be shown, select the role of the object, and browse to the audio file you want to assign to objects with the selected role, then activate the OK button to add it.</li>
<li>To change an existing sound, select its corresponding item from the list, activate the "Change" button, and browse to your desired audio file.</li>
<li>To remove an existing sound, select its corresponding item from the list and activate the "Remove" button. The sound would be removed from the audio theme.</li>
<li>When done, activate the save button, and browse to the folder to which your audio theme package will be saved. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Editing an existing audio theme</h4>
<p>The process of editing an audio theme is almost identical to the process of creating a new audio theme. The only differences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>When activating the "Customize existing audio theme" button from the audio themes studio, a dialog will be opened from which you must select one of your existing audio themes for editing.</li>
<li>When activating the "Save" button in the audio themes editor, the changes would be saved and applied immediately to the selected audio theme. if you want to export, you will find a button to do so in the editer </li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio File Requirements</h3>
<p>When adding sounds to a theme, make sure they meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Format:</strong> The audio files must be in <code>.wav</code> format.</li>
<li><strong>Sample Rate:</strong> The recommended sample rate is 44100 Hz.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exporting Your Theme</h3>
<p>After creating or editing a theme, you can export it as an <code>.atp</code> file. This file can be shared with other users or used as a backup. You can find the export option in the editing screen. when you make a theme for the first time, the export dialog will come up as soon as you hit the save button </p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The "Audio Themes" settings panel provides several options to customize your experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable audio themes:</strong> Toggles the add-on on or off.</li>
<li><strong>Select theme:</strong> Choose the active audio theme.</li>
<li><strong>Play sounds in 3D mode:</strong> Enables or disables 3D audio.</li>
<li><strong>Speak roles...:</strong> When unchecked, NVDA will not speak the role of a control if a sound is played for it.</li>
<li><strong>Speak roles during say all:</strong> When checked, roles will be spoken during a "say all" session.</li>
<li><strong>Use speech synthesizer volume:</strong> When checked, the add-on's volume will match the synthesizer's volume.</li>
<li><strong>Audio themes volume:</strong> Adjust the volume of the audio themes.</li>
<li><strong>Reverb Settings:</strong></li>
